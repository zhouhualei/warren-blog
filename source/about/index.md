### The cities I ever lived in
</a>    

During the past years in my life, I lived in 3 cities in eastern China, they are all in the Yangtze River Delta, as the map shows below:

In 1988, I was born in Zhoushan, Zhejiang Province. It is the biggest archipelago in China, and consists of more than one thousand small islands. I lived in the biggest one. I grew up there with happy memories. I love the clear air in my hometown, and my only complaint would be the yellow sea.

In 2006, I went to study in Tongji University in Shanghai. That's the first time I lived far away from my hometown. And it took almost six hours to travel between these two cities. As we all know, Shanghai is one of the biggest cities in China, its population is more than 20 million. After I received my Master Degree in 2013, I found a job and continued to live in this city with my girlfriend. It always took me almost 1 hour to go to office by crowded subway. The people in this city walked very fast, they always don't care what happened around them because everyone were burdened with tensions and pressures. Obviously, the most important reason is the high housing price. Time flies, ten years passed soon, my son borned in 2016. And I started to think about the future of mine and my whole family. Eventually, I decided to move to HangZhou, to balance my family's life and career. 

In Septemper 2016, I started to work in Hangzhou alone because I needed to prepare everything for my family, and my wife can also had time to find a new job. Hangzhou is a beautiful city, you can see clean river and high willows everywhere, the most famous place here is West Lake. And there are many small moutains you can climb if you have time in weekend or everyday morning. It doesn't give you high pressure, and people living here have more relaxed expressions. That's why I move here. Meanwhile, there are some very famous companies and very good entrepreneurial environment in this city. So I can still pursue for the success in my career. Now I hope my whole family can move to this city soon, and live happily together here.
